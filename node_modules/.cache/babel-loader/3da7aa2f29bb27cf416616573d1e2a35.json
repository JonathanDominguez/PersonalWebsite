I first began my coding journey back in 2013 before entering my freshman year of High School, when I took a summer boot camp on tech startups. Since those summers, I have not looked back I am now currently attending UC Santa Cruz studying Cognitive Science. I have developed a wide variety of skills from my previous tech roles and from classes I have taken as a Cognitive Science major at University of California. I have previously worked as a Front-End Developer and Tech Lead at Teens Exploring Technology. As a Front-End Developer, I produced high-quality mockups, designed 2 prototypes, and 3 wireframes that fit the client\\u2019s requirements, balancing functional and aesthetic designs using Figma. I translated self-created UI/UX design to develop cross-browser and mobile compatible website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React.js). I have also worked on multiple projects where I have had to either create native mobile applications, non-native mobile applications, and websites. One of these projects was a cross-browser and mobile-compatible website that converts a user's input of past work history and generates a resume based on a selected template. At one point I was responsible for managing up to 10 teams that were creating non-native mobile applications that required their own different features to build out. During one of my summers in High School, I created my first native mobile application using Swift which allowed unknown High School students to become known to college sports recruiters. Some of the courses I have taken include: Natural and Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence and Music, Foundations of Video Game Design, Visual and Spatial Cognition, Psychological Data Analysis, Perception, Visual and Spatial Cognition, Invented Languages.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 15,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 13,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 8,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }, this);\n}\n\n_c = AboutMePage;\nexport default AboutMePage;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"AboutMePage\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","MainPic","SniffyBlackOutline","AboutMePage"],"sources":["/Users/jonathandominugez/Desktop/new-portfolio/src/Pages/AboutMePage.js"],"sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\nimport '../Styles/AboutMe.css';\nimport MainPic from '../assets/AboutMePic.jpg'\nimport SniffyBlackOutline from '../assets/sniffyBlackOutline.png'\n\nfunction AboutMePage() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"AboutMePage-body\">\n            <img className=\"logoForSniffy\" src={SniffyBlackOutline} alt=\"sniffyLogo\" width=\"100em\" height=\"100em\"/>\n            <div className=\"imageBox\">\n                <img className=\"imageOfMe\"src={MainPic} alt=\"PicOfMe\"/>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"info-text-box\">\n                <h3 className=\"name-title-about\">Jonathan Dominguez</h3>\n                <p className=\"info-box\">\n                    I'm from South Los Angeles.
